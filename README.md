# METIS Bootcamp - Project 2 

## Wine recommendations with Data Science

The project contains 4 main files with the following activity:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Cleaning & EDA
3. Data Modelling (Linear regressions)
4. The final presentation


Note: As the final dataset is quite big (~200k rows) to improve reproducibility I've commented all heavy-charting for EDA section.
